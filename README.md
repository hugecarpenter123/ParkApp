<h2 style="text-align: center">ParkApp</h2>
<p>ParkApp is an RESTFUL web application that shows all registered parking spaces with frequent refresh. Live updates are performed by receiving request from a given spot 
no matter what sensor is being used to send the data. Application consists of a few subpages, where user can view available parking places, check for free spots and see 
the traffic at given time and place. ParkApp has also statistics functionality (which temporarily is disabled due to rebuild in progress)</p>
